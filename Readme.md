# jQuery and HTML

You can also create HTML elements using jQuery.

$('<h1></h1>');
The code in the example above creates a new <h1> element. Elements that are created using jQuery, however, aren't automatically added to the DOM â€” you must explicitly add them.

To use newly created elements, its useful to store them in a jQuery variable.

var $heading = $('<h1></h1>');
In the example above, the jQuery variable is $heading. The $ character at the start of the variable name does nothing special. It's simply best practice to differentiate jQuery objects from vanilla JavaScript objects by starting a variable name with the $ character.

Finally, it's very common to create an HTML element with jQuery, add information to the element, and then add it to the DOM.

var message = "Welcome to jQuery!"
var $heading = $('<h1>' + message + '</h1>');
$('div').append($heading);
The example above contains a JavaScript variable (message) that stores a string. The second line creates an <h1> element and concatenates the message variable, resulting in a heading element that says Welcome to jQuery. Finally, the heading ($heading) is added to a div.

This sequence of code is frequently used to create or update HTML elements in response to user actions or data.

## jQuery and CSS
Much like HTML, jQuery lets you access CSS properties and values with the .css() method.

$(document).ready(function() {
  $('div.alert').css('background-color');
});
In the example above, the .css() method is called on all divs with a class of alert. The method also has an argument called 'background-color'. What is happening in this example?

Once again, the documentation for this method is the best place to start: https://api.jquery.com/css/.

In the example above, the .css() method retrieves, or returns, the value of the background-color property, regardless of whether or not it has been set in a stylesheet.

According to the documentation, the .css() method can also accept a second argument: a CSS value. This can be used to set CSS properties.

$(document).ready(function() {
  $('div.alert').css('background-color', 'red');
});
In the example above, instead of returning the value of the background-color property, the .css() method sets the background color of all divs with the alert class to red.

When the .css() method is combined with callback functions, you can create more sophisticated interactivity.

## Event Handlers I
For an element to be truly interactive, the element must detect user interactions. This is accomplished with jQuery event handler functions.

$('div.button').on('click', function() {
  // Some behavior goes here
});
In the example above, a div with the class of button has the .on() event handler function attached to it. The event handler accepts two arguments:

An event listener that "listens" for an event ('click' in the example above)
A callback function that is executed when the event is triggered (in this example, when the user clicks)

## Event Handlers II
In the last exercise, you followed three steps to attach an event handler function:

Attach .on()
Specify a valid event as the first argument
Specify a callback function as the second argument
A slightly shorter syntax combines steps 1 and 2.

$('div.button').click(function() {
// Some behavior goes here
});
Functionally, the .click() function in the example above is no different from .on('click', ...) in the last exercise. Both forms are valid, and neither is more acceptable than the other.

It's important to understand both versions of the syntax because both are used by developers. The jQuery documentation uses the shortened syntax demonstrated in the example above, whereas developers may use either version of the syntax. Knowing both forms improves your ability to read other developers' code.

Look at the documentation for a list of valid jQuery events.

## Traversing the DOM
Let's take a look at .find(), a DOM traversal method in jQuery.

$(document).ready(function() {
  $('.button').click(function() {
    var $listItems = $('.button').find('li');
  });
});
Let's break down the example above:

An element with a class of button has a click event handler.
When the click event occurs, the callback function is executed. In the callback function, the .find() method is called on elements with the button class.
The .find() method returns all list items ('li') that are descendants of .button elements.
The descendant list items are then stored in a jQuery variable called $listItems.
The .find() method returns only the descendant elements that match the selector passed to it. In the example above, only list items ('li') will be returned if they are found.

It's common to traverse the DOM and then modify behavior of elements. Be sure to familiarize yourself with some of the methods that jQuery provides to traverse the DOM. Some of the most important methods allow you to traverse parents, siblings, or children.

## $(this)
Take a look at the code below. What do you think this code does?

$(document).ready(function() {
  $('div.alert').click(function() {
    $('div.alert').remove();
  });
});
The code in the example above says: when a div with a class of alert is clicked, remove divs with a class of alert from the DOM.

What if there are multiple divs that share this class? If that is the case, then all divs with the alert class would be removed simultaneously when only one div with a class of alert is clicked.

You can use the this keyword to remove only the div that was clicked.

$(document).ready(function() {
  $('div.alert').click(function() {
    $(this).remove();
  });
});
In the example above, only the div that is clicked will be removed.

The div.alert selector targets all divs with the alert class, while the this keyword targets only the specific div.alert element that is clicked, or interacted with.
1.
Take a look at the following lines of code in main.js:

var $parent = $('.glyphicon-remove').parent();
$parent.remove();
When the x symbol is clicked, all list items are removed from the list. This is because we are currently instructing jQuery to remove all parents of elements with a class of glyphicon-remove. That is, all list items are removed when any x symbol is clicked.

Let's fix this bug. Use the this keyword to return the parents of only the x symbol that is clicked.

Once again, add multiple list items in List Maker. After they are added, click on their corresponding x symbol to remove them. What do you notice now?

You did it! List Maker now works as intended!

## Chaining methods
Behaviors in jQuery can be chained together in series. For example, it's common to traverse the DOM and then apply a style or behavior to targeted elements, all with one line of code!

$(document).ready(function() {
  $('div.button').click(function() {
    $(this).find('li').css('background-color', 'red');
  });
});
In the example above, the .css() method is chained to the .find() method. When the div of class button is clicked, all descendant list items will change their background color to red.

Visual methods that employ animation can be chained as well.

$(document).ready(function() {
  $('div.button').click(function() {
    $(this).find('li').fadeOut(1000);
  });
});
In the code above, after a div with the class button is clicked, all descendant list items will fade out over the course of one second.

Chaining supports multiple effects linked in succession. For example, we can chain the .css() and .fadeOut() methods together, resulting in the line of code below.

$(this).find('li').css('background-color', 'red').fadeOut(1000);
In the method chain above, descendant list items will first change their color to red and then fade out over one second.
Instructions
1.
Take a look at the following lines of code in main.js:

var $parent = $(this).parent();
$parent.remove();
Although these two lines successfully work together to remove individual list items, we can shorten them to one line of code using chaining.

Combine the two lines of code by chaining the .remove() method to the .parent() method. Remove all references to the $parent variable.

## Add & Remove classes
Earlier you learned about.css(), a method helpful for manipulating individual CSS properties.

To set multiple CSS properties simultaneously, it's best to use the .addClass() and .removeClass() methods. These methods can add or remove a collection of CSS properties at once.

/* CSS rule in a stylesheet 
.highlight {
  border: 1px solid orange;
  background-color: yellow;
}
The example above sets CSS properties for elements with a class of highlight. This CSS rule can be added or removed with jQuery.

// Adding class with jQuery
$(document).ready(function() {
  $('li').addClass('highlight');
});
In the example above, the .addClass() method is used to add the highlight class to all list items in the DOM. All of the list items will have an orange border and yellow background color.

Adding (or removing) classes can be useful when linked to user actions (i.e. clicking a button, hovering over an element, etc.).
1.
Now that List Maker functions correctly, we can focus on styling parts of it.

Open style.css and scroll through the file. Find the .button-hover CSS rule. This rule contains styling that we will conditionally add to an element. Specifically, we'll apply this styling to the + buttons when a user hovers over them.

In main.js, start by selecting all divs that have a class of button. Add an event handler that responds to a "hover" event. Make sure to include a callback function as an argument, but leave its contents empty for now.

This event handler should stand alone and be on the same indentation-level as the event handlers for #title-form .button and #item-form .button.

2.
Inside of the callback function, call the .addClass() method on the specific element being hovered over. Pass in the button-hover class you saw in style.css as an argument.
Stuck? Get a hint
3.
Hover over either of the + buttons. What happens?

The buttons change color on hover, but the change seems to be permanent (we added the class). It would seem that the next step would be to write jQuery that handles a removal of the class. This, however, would defeat the purpose of the hover event.

Instead, let's fix this issue by calling a different method. Use your preferred search engine to search for the method that "toggles" a class. Once you find it, replace .addClass() with the method.

Again, try finding the method by using your preferred search engine first. If you need help, then use the hint.

4.
Hover over either of the + buttons again. They should change in color when the cursor hovers over them and then revert back to normal when the cursor exits the button.

It's possible to add this functionality with pure CSS using a :hover pseudo-selector. For the purposes of this lesson, however, we're deliberately keeping the event handling in main.js. There is no preferred method, so feel free to make this choice for yourself in your personal projects.

Congratulations on completing List Maker!
